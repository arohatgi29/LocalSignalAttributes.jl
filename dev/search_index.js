We define local attributes with the help of regularized inversion and demonstrate their usefulness for measuring local frequencies of signals and local similarity between different datasets. We use shaping regularization for controlling the locality and smoothness of local attributes. We return to the definition of simple data attributes to learn how to turn them from global to localized measures using linear estimation tools and shaping regularization.","category":"page"},{"location":"#Installation","page":"Home","title":"Installation","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"julia> using Pkg\n\njulia> Pkg.add(\"LocalSignalAttributes\")","category":"page"},{"location":"Tutorial/generate_synthetics/#Generating-Synthetics-with-the-LocalSignalAttributes.jl-Package","page":"Generate Synthetics","title":"Generating Synthetics with the LocalSignalAttributes.jl Package","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"Tutorial/generate_synthetics/","page":"Generate Synthetics","title":"Generate Synthetics","text":"The LocalSignalAttributes.jl package provides tools to generate synthetic seismic signals.
